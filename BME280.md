# Data Collection
To collect data from your BME680 sensor, publish it to a message broker (like MQTT), and then store it in InfluxDB, you'll need to set up a few components: MQTT broker (such as Mosquitto), a Python script to publish sensor data, and configure Telegraf to collect data from MQTT and send it to InfluxDB. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Setting Up Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)
Install Mosquitto:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```
Start and Enable Mosquitto:
```
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
```
Verify Mosquitto Status:
```
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```
