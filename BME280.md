# BME280 Sensor Data Collection with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up a BME280 sensor with a Raspberry Pi, installing necessary software, wiring the sensor, and running a Python script to collect temperature, pressure, and humidity data via I2C communication.

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)
- BME280 sensor
- Jumper wires
- Internet connection for package installation

## Software Setup

### 1. Install Required Packages

Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip i2c-tools git
```
### 2. Enable I2C Interface 
Run sudo raspi-config in the terminal, navigate to Interfacing Options -> I2C -> Yes to enable the I2C interface. Reboot your Raspberry Pi for changes to take effect:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
```
### 3. Install Python Libraries
Install the smbus2 and RPi.bme280 Python libraries using pip:
```
bash
Copy code
pip3 install smbus2 RPi.bme280
```
### 4. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you haven't already, clone your project repository:
```
bash
Copy code
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

## Hardware Setup

### BME280 Sensor Wiring

| BME280 Pin | Raspberry Pi GPIO Header Pin |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| VCC        | 3.3V                        |
| GND        | GND                         |
| SCK        | SCL1 (GPIO 3)               |
| MOSI       | SDA1 (GPIO 2)               |
| MISO/ADDR  | Not connected               |
| CS         | Not connected               |

- **VCC**: Connect to Raspberry Pi 3.3V pin.
- **GND**: Connect to Raspberry Pi GND pin.
- **SCK**: Connect to Raspberry Pi SCL1 pin (GPIO 3).
- **MOSI**: Connect to Raspberry Pi SDA1 pin (GPIO 2).
- **MISO/ADDR** and **CS**: Not used in I2C mode.

### SCK (Serial Clock):
**Usage:** Used in SPI communication to synchronize data transmission between devices.
**Function:** It controls the timing and rate at which data is transmitted between devices.

### SCL1 (Serial Clock Line):
**Usage:** Used in I2C communication to synchronize data transmission between devices.
**Function:** Similar to SCK in SPI, it controls the timing and rate of data transmission but operates under the I2C protocol.

**In summary:**

SCK is specific to SPI communication.
SCL1 is specific to I2C communication.
They serve analogous purposes but are used in different communication protocols.

## Python Script for Data Collection
Create a Python script (datacollection.py for example) in your project folder, you can clone the script from this repository.
