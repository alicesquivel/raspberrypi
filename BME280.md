## 1. Set Up Raspberry Pi (Data Collection)

### 1. Install Raspberry Pi OS
**Download Raspberry Pi OS:**

Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite or Desktop from the official Raspberry Pi website: raspberrypi.org/downloads.
**Write OS Image to SD Card:**

Use a tool like Raspberry Pi Imager or balenaEtcher to write the OS image to your SD card.
**Configure Raspberry Pi OS:**

Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Raspberry Pi OS, including language, keyboard layout, Wi-Fi setup (if needed), and setting a new password.

### 2. Update System Packages
Open Terminal:
Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi or connect to it via SSH.
Update Package Lists:
```
sudo apt update
```
Upgrade Installed Packages:
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
Clean Up Unused Packages:
```
sudo apt autoremove

```
### 3. Install Required Packages
Python Libraries:

Install necessary Python libraries for sensor data collection and MQTT publishing:
```
sudo pip install bme680 paho-mqtt
```
Enable I2C Interface (if using I2C sensors):

If your sensor communicates via I2C, enable the I2C interface:
```
Run sudo raspi-config.
Navigate to Interfacing Options -> I2C -> Yes to enable the I2C interface.
```

### 4. Connect and Test Sensor (BME680)
Connect Sensor:
Connect your BME680 sensor to the Raspberry Pi according to its datasheet or manufacturer's instructions. Ensure power (VCC/GND) and communication (I2C/SPI) lines are correctly connected.
Test Sensor Communication:

Run a test script to ensure the sensor is communicating correctly.

## 2. Set Up Cloud VM (InfluxDB and Telegraf)
Create a Virtual Machine:

Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and create a VM instance.
Install Ubuntu or your preferred Linux distribution on the VM.

Install InfluxDB and Telegraf:

Follow the respective installation instructions for InfluxDB and Telegraf on your VM.
Configure InfluxDB with a database (mydatabase) and set up a user (your_username and your_password).
Configure Telegraf (/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf):
Update Telegraf configuration to subscribe to MQTT for pressure data and store it in InfluxDB:
```
[[inputs.mqtt_consumer]]
  servers = ["tcp://localhost:1883"]  # Replace with your MQTT broker address
  topics = [
    "sensor/pressure"
  ]
  qos = 1
  data_format = "json"
  json_string_fields = ["timestamp"]
  name_override = "pressure_sensor"
  tag_keys = ["timestamp"]

[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://INFLUXDB_VM_IP:8086"]  # Replace with your InfluxDB VM address
  database = "mydatabase"
  username = "your_username"
  password = "your_password"
  retention_policy = ""
  timeout = "5s"
  influx_skip_database_creation = true
```
Replace placeholders (localhost, 1883, INFLUXDB_VM_IP, 8086, mydatabase, your_username, your_password) with your actual values.

Restart Telegraf:
```
sudo systemctl restart telegraf
```
Monitor Telegraf logs (sudo journalctl -u telegraf -f) to ensure it starts correctly and handles data ingestion from MQTT.

## 3. Verify and Monitor
Monitor MQTT Activity:
Use MQTT client tools (mosquitto_sub or similar) to subscribe to sensor/pressure topic and verify data publication.

**Check InfluxDB:**

Access InfluxDB from your cloud VM or local machine using influx CLI or InfluxDB UI.
Verify data storage in the mydatabase database under the pressure_sensor measurement.

**Notes:**
1. Security: Ensure proper security measures (e.g., firewall rules, encryption) are applied to your MQTT broker, InfluxDB, and VM instance.
2. Expansion: To add more sensors, extend the Python script to handle additional sensor data and update Telegraf configuration accordingly.
