# Data Collection
To collect data from your BME680 sensor, publish it to a message broker (like MQTT), and then store it in InfluxDB, you'll need to set up a few components: MQTT broker (such as Mosquitto), a Python script to publish sensor data, and configure Telegraf to collect data from MQTT and send it to InfluxDB. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Setting Up Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)
Install Mosquitto:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```
Start and Enable Mosquitto:
```
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
```
Verify Mosquitto Status:
```
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```
## Step 2: Python Script to Publish Sensor Data
Create a Python script that reads data from the BME680 sensor and publishes it to a topic on the MQTT broker (Mosquitto in this case).

## Step 3: Installing Required Libraries
Ensure you have bme680 and paho-mqtt libraries installed:
```
pip install bme680 paho-mqtt
```

## Step 4: Configuring Telegraf for MQTT and InfluxDB Integration
Install Telegraf (if not already installed):
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install telegraf
```
Configure Telegraf:
Edit the Telegraf configuration file (/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf):
```
sudo nano /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
```
Add the following sections to configure MQTT input and InfluxDB output:
```
[[inputs.mqtt_consumer]]
  servers = ["tcp://localhost:1883"]  # Replace with your MQTT broker address
  topics = [
    "sensor/bme680"  # Topic to subscribe
  ]
  qos = 1
  data_format = "json"
  json_string_fields = ["timestamp"]
  name_override = "bme680_sensor"
  tag_keys = ["timestamp"]

[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://localhost:8086"]  # Replace with your InfluxDB address
  database = "mydatabase"  # Replace with your InfluxDB database name
  username = "your_username"
  password = "your_password"
  retention_policy = ""
  timeout = "5s"
  influx_skip_database_creation = true
```

Make sure to replace placeholders (localhost, 1883, 8086, mydatabase, your_username, your_password) with your actual values.

Restart Telegraf:
```
sudo systemctl restart telegraf
```

## Step 5: Verify Data in InfluxDB
Check InfluxDB to see if data from the BME680 sensor is being stored:
```
influx
> use mydatabase
> show measurements
> select * from bme680_sensor
```

## Notes:
Security: Ensure your MQTT and InfluxDB configurations are secure (e.g., using authentication, encryption).
Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling in your Python script and Telegraf configuration to handle connectivity issues or data format mismatches.
Timestamp Handling: Depending on your use case, you may need to adjust how timestamps are formatted and handled between Python, MQTT, and InfluxDB.
