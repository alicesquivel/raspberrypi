## Hardware Setup
Ensure your BME280 sensor is wired to your Raspberry Pi according to the I2C interface as described in Table:
| BME280 Pin    | Raspberry Pi Pin (BCM) | Description               |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| VCC           | 1 or 2 (3.3V/5V)       | Power supply (3.3V or 5V)  |
| GND           | 6                      | Ground                    |
| SCK (Clock)   | 5 (GPIO 3)             | I2C Clock                 |
| SDA (Data)    | 3 (GPIO 2)             | I2C Data                  |
| MISO/ADDR     | Not connected          | Not used                  |
| CS            | Not connected          | Not used                  |

### Explanation:
* VCC (Power): Connect to either 3.3V or 5V power supply based on your sensor's specifications.
* GND (Ground): Connect to a ground pin (pin 6 on Raspberry Pi).
* SCK (Clock): Connect to GPIO 3 (BCM pin 5), which handles clock signal in I2C communication.
* SDA (Data): Connect to GPIO 2 (BCM pin 3), which handles data signal in I2C communication.
* MISO/ADDR and CS: These pins are not used in I2C communication mode and should not be connected.

## Creating a Virtual Environment without virtualenv
Create a Directory for Your Virtual Environment:
Navigate to your home directory or any preferred location. For example:
```
bash
Copy code
cd ~
```
Create a new directory for your virtual environment. You can name it env or any name you prefer:
```
bash
Copy code
mkdir env
```
## Setup Python3 Virtual Environment:
Use the built-in venv module in Python3 to create a virtual environment:
```
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate the Virtual Environment:
```
bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
```
Your command prompt should now change to indicate that you are working within the virtual environment ((env) prefix).

## Software Setup

1. **Check WiringPi Installation**:
   ```bash
   gpio -v


If version 2.52 or later is shown, WiringPi is installed correctly. If not, follow the installation instructions for WiringPi:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```
Install SPI Support and Tools:
Ensure SPI is enabled on your Raspberry Pi:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to Interfacing Options -> SPI -> Yes and enable SPI. Reboot your Raspberry Pi:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
```
Install Required Libraries:
Ensure Python libraries for SPI communication are installed:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
pip3 install spidev
```
Clone WiringPi-Python Repository:
If you haven't already, clone the WiringPi-Python repository:
```
bash
Copy code
git clone --recursive https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python.git
cd WiringPi-Python
```
Build and Install WiringPi-Python:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
Verify SPI and I2C:
After installation, verify that both SPI and I2C are enabled and functioning:
```
bash
Copy code
lsmod | grep spi
lsmod | grep i2c
```
Connect BME280 and Test:
Now you can use a Python script to read data from the BME280 sensor over SPI. Here's a basic example script (bme280_test.py) to get you started:
