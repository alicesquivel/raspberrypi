## 1. Set Up Raspberry Pi (Data Collection)

#### Sensor documentation: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/BME680_Environmental_Sensor 

### Update System Packages
Open Terminal:
Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi or connect to it via SSH.
Update Package Lists:
```
sudo apt update
```
Upgrade Installed Packages:
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
Clean Up Unused Packages:
```
sudo apt autoremove
```
### Install Required Packages
Python Libraries:

Install necessary Python libraries for sensor data collection and MQTT publishing:
```
pip3 install bme680 paho-mqtt
```
Enable I2C Interface (if using I2C sensors):

If your sensor communicates via I2C, enable the I2C interface:
```
Run sudo raspi-config.
Navigate to Interfacing Options -> I2C -> Yes to enable the I2C interface.
```

### 4. Connect and Test Sensor (BME680)
Connect Sensor:
Connect your BME680 sensor to the Raspberry Pi according to its datasheet or manufacturer's instructions. Ensure power (VCC/GND) and communication (I2C/SPI) lines are correctly connected.
Test Sensor Communication:

Run a test script to ensure the sensor is communicating correctly.
```
Sensor connected: True
```

## 2. Set Up Cloud VM in Chameleon Cloud (InfluxDB and Telegraf)
Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine
Create Ubuntu 22.04 VM:
Create a virtual machine instance with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Connect to VM:
SSH into your Ubuntu VM using your preferred SSH client.

### 2. Install InfluxDB
Update Package Lists:
```
sudo apt update
```
Install InfluxDB:
```
sudo apt install influxdb
```
Start and Enable InfluxDB Service:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb
sudo systemctl enable influxdb
```
Configure InfluxDB:
Access the InfluxDB CLI:
```
influx
```
Create a database named mydatabase:
```
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase
```
Create a user (replace your_username and your_password with your desired credentials):
```
CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
```
Exit the InfluxDB CLI:
```
exit
```
### 3. Install Telegraf
Download and Install Telegraf:
```
sudo apt install telegraf
```

**Notes:**
1. Security: Ensure proper security measures (e.g., firewall rules, encryption) are applied to your MQTT broker, InfluxDB, and VM instance.
2. Expansion: To add more sensors, extend the Python script to handle additional sensor data and update Telegraf configuration accordingly.

Verify Sensor Readings:

Check if the sensor can read basic data (temperature, pressure, humidity) using sample scripts provided by the sensor manufacturer or library documentation.

## 5. Set Up MQTT Broker (Optional, if not using cloud-based MQTT)
Install MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto):
If you're not using a cloud-based MQTT broker, install Mosquitto:
```
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```
Configure and Start Mosquitto:
Mosquitto should start automatically after installation. Configure it as needed for your network setup and security.

## 6. Secure Raspberry Pi
Change Default Password:

Ensure you change the default password for the pi user and create a new user with appropriate permissions if necessary.
Enable Firewall (UFW):
Set up a firewall (UFW) to restrict access to your Raspberry Pi:
```
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow ssh  # Allow SSH access
sudo ufw enable
```
